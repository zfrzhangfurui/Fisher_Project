I and my friend Tim were haired by a Horse Racing fan to develop a Horse Racing prediction application. It is a web-based application which javascript(angular-js), PHP and Mysql were applied in the application. 
In order to hanle over 6 Million records, we use stored-procedure to write the algorithm of data to give a better profermence (all data sent to PHP will be filterd and sorted to gain more efficiency).Index is used to rapidly reduce the fetching time(a full fetching time used to be 20mins, we reduce it to 1min).
We use PHP as a intermediate to link front-end to back-end. A new method of requiring data from database was used in the application. Althrough it didn't give more benefit to the application, it provide a easilier way to program in PHP(logical way).
In the front-end, Angular-js + bootstrap were used to display all the information. In this section, Angular-js is boost the process of building up the front-end.

Two main part is procedure and report.
